# IDM Risk Dashboarad
__Identity Manager__ Risk Dashboard__ Solution Accelerator

## Overview
This solution accelerator provides a Power BI-based dashboard to visualize possible risk areas from within the One Identity Manager configuration.

## More information
The IGA Risk Dashboard is intended to look for areas where there are vulnerabilities in the configuration of a customer's One Identity Manager environment.  This may include things like:
- High risk users
- Attestations that are overdue
- Accounts that are inactive, but there is still activity detected on them
- Accounts that haven't been used in a long time

Also, there are what we call Data Quality issues.  These are not necessarily vulnerabilities or risks.  However, if the customer is depending on certain items being provided which aren't provided, it may result in a vulnerability.

Please refer to the Word document for more information on the dashboard.

## Supportability
This Solution Accelerator is delivered "as is".  Any issues encountered can be reported on Github and contributors will make a best effort to resolve them.
